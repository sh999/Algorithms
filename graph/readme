Basic graph implementation in C

Comparison of data structure representation of graphs
Adjacency matrix
	n = # of nodes
	O(n) for enumerating outedges
		Enumerating outedges is a similar problem to finding neighbors to a vertex, which is a crucial component in graph traversals. Adjacency list is better for this if the graph is not fully dense.
	O(n^2) space
